      There's no silver bullet when it comes to achieving a Zero Trust security
      architecture. That's because every organization is at a different stage of
      its journey, but identity is at the heart of any successful adoption.
      We've broken down the stages of Identity adoption and progression through
      a Zero Trust journey for you to base yourself against.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okta seamlessly integrates your identity solution across your entire
      technology ecosystem, and partners with other security leaders, to unify
      your approach to Zero Trust. Interested in where your organization falls
      on this maturity curve? Take our Zero Trust Assessment to get personalized
      recommendations on how to tackle the Zero Trust journey with identity and
      secure your organization.Customer Identity is so much more than just the
      login box - from keeping every click safe to increasing acquisition and
      retention. Empower app developers, digital leaders, and security teams to
      accelerate time to market and grow your business. Customer Identity is so

      Empower app developers, digital leaders, and security teams to accelerate
      time to market and grow your business. Customer Identity and Access
      Management is how companies give end users access to their digital
      properties. It's also how they govern, collect, analyze, and securely
      store all that user data. So if an awesome registration and login
      experience is currently delighting your customers, you're likely doing
      Identity right. Not quite there yet? It's OK. That's why we created the
      Customer Identity Cloud â€” so you could leave authentication to us. Okta's
      Customer Identity Cloud helps you build strong digital relationships, keep
      users' clicks safe, and free up developers' time for other projects.
